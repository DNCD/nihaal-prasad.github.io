        Hey there everyone! My name is Nihaal Prasad, and I'm the author of this blog. I'm currently a freshman studying Computer Science at George Mason University, and I hope to pursue a career in cybersecurity.</p>
    <p>
        Like most other people who are in the IT field, most of my knowledge about computer science comes from me just messing around with technology. I first started learning how to code my own programs when I was eleven, and since then, I've been trying to learn as much as possible about computer systems, sometimes spending hours writing or analyzing code. It was then when I discovered my passion for logically solving problems.

        I started to seriously consider cybersecurity as a career during my junior year of high school, where I competed in a cybersecurity competition that was hosted by <a href="https://www.fbla-pbl.org/">FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America)</a> and won tenth place nationally. Since then, I've mainly been working on grabbing certifications, honing my skills in CTF competitions, and trying to acquire as much knowledge as possible.

        I wrote this blog in order to consolidate some of the things that I have learned in the past, keep track of what I am currently learning, analyze some of the latest cyber news, and help other people who might be a little bit newer to this field. I hope you guys enjoy reading it :)
